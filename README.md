# Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model

•	Integrated Python’s TensorFlow Machine Learning library and built a deep artificial neural network that implements a logistic regression algorithm.
•	Utilized the necessary activation functions in the neural network to solve the binary classification problem.
•	Trained and evaluated the Machine Learning Model using a real-world dataset, which achieved a 78% accuracy.
•	achieved 78% accuracy by utilizing the Machine Learning Model to predict new data
